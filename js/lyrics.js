[00:11.798]Who can say where the road goes,
[00:17.237]Where the day flows
[00:19.839]Only time...
[00:23.116]And who can say if your love grows,
[00:28.033]As your heart chose
[00:31.105]Only time...
[00:37.971](chants)
[01:01.398]Who can say why your heart sighs,
[01:06.489]As your love flies
[01:09.107]Only time...
[01:11.989]And who can say why your heart cries,
[01:17.363]When your love dies
[01:20.521]Only time...
[01:27.825](chants)
[01:50.416]Who can say when the roads meet,
[01:55.097]That love might be,
[01:58.518]In your heart.
[02:01.477]And who can say when the day sleeps,
[02:06.941]If the night keeps all your hearts
[02:12.517]Night keeps all your heart...
[02:22.448](extended chants)
[02:44.331]Who can say if your love grows,
[02:49.427]As your heart chose
[02:52.567]Only time...
[02:56.035]And who can say where the road goes,
[03:00.368]Where the day flows
[03:03.703]Only time...
[03:07.471]Who knows
[03:10.385]Only time...
[03:12.071]Who knows
[03:15.510]Only time...

    How: `
[00:10.522]My life goes on in endless song
[00:18.393]above earth’s lamentations,
[00:25.430]I hear the real, though far-off hymn
[00:33.080]that hails a new creation.
[00:41.576]Through all the tumult and the strife
[00:48.957]I hear it’s music ringing,
[00:55.102]it sounds an echo in my soul.
[01:03.471]How can I keep from singing?
[01:12.477]While though the tempest loudly roars,
[01:19.929]I hear the truth, it liveth.
[01:26.440]And though the darkness ’round me close,
[01:33.655]songs in the night it giveth.
[01:39.874]No storm can shake my innermost calm,
[01:47.129]while to that rock I’m clinging.
[01:53.811]Since love is lord of heaven and earth
[02:02.012]how can I keep from singing?
[02:10.873]lalalalalala......
[02:30.113]When tyrants tremble in their fear
[02:37.777]and hear their death knell ringing,
[02:45.002]when friends rejoice both far and near
[02:52.750]how can I keep from singing?
[03:00.138]In prison cell and dungeon vile
[03:07.436]our thoughts to them are winging,
[03:13.385]when friends by shame are undefiled
[03:21.562]how can I keep from singing?
[03:30.319]lalalalalala......
